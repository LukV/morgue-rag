## CHAPTER I — An Evening in the Marais

There are truths too terrible to confess aloud. And yet I find myself returning, again and again, to the sequence of those days in Paris — not for clarity, but perhaps as punishment.

The events I am about to relate transpired during the second spring of my acquaintance with Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. We had taken up rooms together in the Rue Dunôt, not far from the Marais, and our days passed in idle study, our nights in errant walks through the mist-laden boulevards.

One evening, as we wandered home under a bruised sky, Dupin paused abruptly in his stride. “Have you observed the police gazette this morning?” he asked, producing the folded broadsheet from within his coat. He tapped twice upon a column with his gloved index finger.

“An atrocity in the Rue Morgue. Two women, mother and daughter, murdered in their apartment. The nature of the violence exceeds ordinary comprehension.”

We returned home at once, Dupin aflame with an energy I had seen in him only on rare occasions — once, when he solved the matter of the minister’s letter, and again when he divined the hidden message in a sailor’s tattoo.

At his insistence, I read the article aloud. The language was lurid, describing the room in which the bodies were found as a “charnel-house of rage,” the elder woman decapitated, the younger one strangled and forced into the chimney. Witnesses heard guttural cries in no known language, followed by silence. The windows were latched from within.

“A locked-room puzzle,” Dupin murmured, eyes unfocused. “We must see it for ourselves.”

We had been walking apart that evening — Dupin ahead of me, disappearing now and then into alleys with some excuse or other. He said he was following the scent of a literary clue he had found in a bookseller’s catalogue. I thought nothing of it at the time.

We arrived at the Rue Morgue shortly after noon the next day. The gendarmes had cordoned off the building, but Dupin, with a few well-chosen words and his letter of acquaintance from the Prefect, gained us entrance.

The apartment was in dreadful disarray — broken glass, overturned chairs, a bloody razor on the floor. The old woman lay sprawled across the hearth, her neck severed by what must have been tremendous force. The chimney bore dark smears, and in its flue was the crumpled form of the daughter.

Dupin said little, moving from object to object with mechanical precision. He knelt beside the razor, examined the window latches, tested the spring of a floorboard near the desk. Then, without a word, he turned to the gendarme and requested that the bodies not be moved.

“There is yet more to be understood,” he said.

That night, over brandy, he declared the crime to be the work of a non-human agent. “The strength required, the incoherent cries — it is no man.”

“Then what?” I asked.

“An ape. Likely an orangutan, escaped from some sailor’s quarters.”

I said nothing, but a chill threaded its way down my spine.
